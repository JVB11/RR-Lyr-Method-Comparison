# RR-Lyr-Method-Comparison




The    software    package    we    developed for   period-metallicity luminosity relation (of RR Lyrae pulsators) validation   purposes   consists   of   several   independently   working    python    scripts    (as    well    as    some    necessary    modules).  It  should  easily  be  extend-able to other PML relations/approaches (such as Period-Wesenheit relations.
