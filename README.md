# RR-Lyr-Method-Comparison

The    software    package    we    developed for   period-metallicity luminosity relation (of RR Lyrae pulsators) validation   purposes   consists   of   several   independently   working    python    scripts    (as    well    as    some    necessary    modules).  It  should  easily  be  extend-able to other PML relations/approaches (such as for example Period-Wesenheit relations).

# Query scripts:
Several query scripts based on the Astroquery python package (Ginsburg et al. 2018) were developed in order to easily extract data from the VizieR database (Ochsenbein  et  al.  2000).
